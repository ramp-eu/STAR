Our solution consists the deployment of a single Techman 12 cobot mounted on a large table with two defined
spaces (vision system selection area and stitching/ taping area). The function of the is to pick (using a vacuum
gripper) the acoustic parts from selection area, present the part to a stitching machine or taping machine. The
robot then guides the part through either machine while a coordinated operation edge tapes or stitches the part.
Finally, the cobot will place the part down for manual removal and QC checks.
